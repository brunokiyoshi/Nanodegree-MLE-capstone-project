# Nanodegree-MLE-capstone-project
Capstone Project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
This work engineers technical analysis features into two datasets, which contain price data for WEGE3 and BOVA11 stocks. Both datasets are used as input to predict prices and directions of price movements of WEGE3.
Two Pytorch models are trained and deployed in "capstone_project.ipynb", one regressor and one classificator. Both models rely on LSTMs.
Required packages: “os”, “sklearn”, “pandas”, “datetime”, “numpy”, “matplotlib”, “torch”, “sagemaker” and “boto3”.
